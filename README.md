## Github Operations

The administration of the `agntcy` github org is conducted by designated admins,
including but not limited to [working-group](working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md)
leaders.

Please use [agntcy discussions](https://github.com/orgs/agntcy/discussions) or
[agntcy slack #git-operations](https://agntcy.slack.com/archives/C08S2BSEF8R** to follow
communication and participate in discussions for topics related to github
operations, e.g. administering users, teams, repos, actions/envs, packages, etc.

**Administrators/working-group leads:** refer to the [org-admin wiki](https://github.com/agntcy/org-admin/wiki)
