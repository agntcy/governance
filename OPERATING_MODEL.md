# The AGNTCY Charter & Operating Model

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Name & Identity

- **Project**: **The** **AGNTCY (aka Internet of Agents Project, or the Project)**
- **Identity**: The AGNTCY (pronounced "agency") Project is the collective of contributors and maintainers building the Internet of Agents (IoA): an open, interoperable, internet for agent-to-agent collaboration.

### 1.2 Mission & Vision

- **Mission**: Provide a collaborative environment where contributors of all backgrounds can innovate, develop, and maintain software components that solve key problems in the domain of agentic workflows and multi agent application creation: agent identity, agent announcement, agent discovery and search, agent connectivity, agent to agent collaboration, agentic ensembles deployment, supervision, observability, security and more. Simply put, we intend to build the Internet of Agents, *together*.

*Figure 1: The Internet of Agents simplified architecture*

- **Vision**: We envision a future where Agentic AI systems transform industries by enabling the developer community, partners, and enterprises to build intelligent, autonomous AI applications. This new AI-native world needs a communication layer, *the Internet of Agents*, to enable collaboration across the ecosystem of agentic applications of various kinds, from different vendors, across different industries.
    - Agentic software will accelerate all of human work â€“ cognitive, services, and physical. Enterprises will need to create deterministic workflows or planner-based jobs and applications, combining internal and third-party agents, to fully leverage the power of AI to accelerate their business and unlock new step-change in productivity.
    - An open, neutral and interoperable Internet of Agents drives maximum value for all players: infrastructure and tool builders, operators, app developers, and consumers. It avoids vendor lock-in.

authority.  The processes that govern working group formation, operation, and dissolution are defined per the
[working-group processes](WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md).  Contributions made under the direction and authority of working-groups
are expected to conform to the same processes defined in the AGNTCY operating model as defined in this document, unless
deviation is specifically defined in the working-group's approved charter.

---

## 4. Decision-Making Process

### 4.1 Consensus Seeking

- **Proposal Discussion**: Open issues or pull requests on GitHub for discussion.
- **Review Window**: Maintain a minimum discussion period (e.g., 3--5 business days) for meaningful member feedback.
- **Approval**: If no major objections are raised, the proposal is considered accepted.
- **Escalation**: When disagreements persist, the relevant Technical Lead or Technical Steering Committee member mediates.

### 4.2 Lazy Consensus

- For minor changes or routine updates, maintainers can merge after a brief review period if there are no objections.

### 4.3 Formal Votes

- On critical changes (e.g., major feature adoption, license amendments), the Technical Steering Committee may call a vote.
- **Simple Majority**: Required for most issues; **Two-Thirds Majority** for fundamental changes or governance modifications.

---

## 5. Contribution Workflow

Contribution workflows can be established for each respective AGNTCY affiliate project, however, the below are recommended guidelines.

### 5.1 Source Code Management

- **Repository**: GitHub (or potentially GitLab) serves as the central code repository.
- **Branching Strategy**:
    1. **main** (stable production branch).
    2. **feature/XYZ** branches for new functionality.
    3. **release/X.Y** branches for versioned releases.

### 5.2 Issue Tracking & Labeling

- **Issue System**: GitHub Issues for bugs, enhancements, and user stories.
- **Labeling**:
    1. **good first issue**: For newcomers.
    2. **help wanted**: For issues needing broader community input.
    3. **bug**, **enhancement**, **documentation**, etc. for clarity.

### 5.3 **Pull Request Reviews**

- **Minimum Approvals**: At least one maintainer or module lead must approve. Two approvals recommended for larger features.
- **Automated CI**: Must pass all tests (unit, integration, lint) before merge.
- **Code Quality**: Follow coding standards, best practices, and style guidelines documented in CONTRIBUTING.md.

### 5.4 **Testing & Releases**

- **Continuous Integration**: Use a CI service (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins) to automate builds and tests.
- **Release Cadence**:
    - **Monthly Minor Releases**: Include new features, improvements, and bug fixes.
    - **Quarterly Major/Minor**: Larger milestones or architectural changes.
    - **Patch Releases**: For urgent bug or security fixes.
