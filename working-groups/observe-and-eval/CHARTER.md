# AGNTCY Observe and Eval Working Group Charter

## Mission

The Observe and Eval working group mission is to contribute to setting and maintaining standards for observability and evaluation of multi-agentic systems.

## Goals

The goals of this working group can be divided into two main axes, observability and evaluation.

On the observability axis, the main goal is to set up a comprehensive observability solution, taking into account the different AGNTCY components (such as AGP or ACP).
This includes:
- Defining and maintaining an observability data schema integrating component observables.
- Proposing a methodology for multi-agentic systems observability.
- Offering an SDK for observability instrumentation.
- Integrating third-party observability instrumentation.

On the evaluation axis, the goal is to propose a data schema for evaluation metrics and standardize how ratings for a multi-agentic system is published in the OASF schema.

## Scope

This group would be responsible of everything that is related to observability and evaluation of multi-agentic systems.
This group will contribute to the [OASF](https://github.com/agntcy/oasf) repository.
