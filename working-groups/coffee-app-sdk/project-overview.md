# Coffee AGNTCY Platform â€“ GitHub Project Overview

Welcome to the **Coffee AGNTCY Platform** project! This GitHub Project coordinates work across two core repositories:

- [`app-sdk`](https://github.com/agntcy/app-sdk): SDK for building interoperable AI agents.
- [`coffeeAgntcy`](https://github.com/agntcy/coffeeAgntcy): A reference application showcasing agent workflows using the SDK.

These two repos evolve together, new features in the SDK are tested and validated through CoffeeAgntcy, and real-world app demands drive SDK improvements.
