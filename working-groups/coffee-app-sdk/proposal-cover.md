# Proposal to Create CoffeeAgntcy & App-SDK Working Group

We propose forming a new WG under AGNTCY to coordinate the development of the `app-sdk` and `coffeeAgntcy` repositories.

**Why now:**  
- SDK and CoffeeAgntcy evolve together
- Seeing clear interest in evolving the repos together as a reference application 
- Clear WG ensures transparency, accountability, and alignment across contributors.  

**Scope:**  
- SDK interface design and implementation.  
- CoffeeAgntcy as reference multi-agent application.  
- Shared demos, docs, and developer patterns.

We request TSC review and approval in the upcoming meeting.
