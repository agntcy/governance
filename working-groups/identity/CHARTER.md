# AGNTCY Identity Working Group Charter

## Mission

The mission of this working group is to contribute to the definition of standards focused on identity in multi-agentic systems.

## Goals

The goals of this working group can be summarized as follows:

- Defining mechanisms enabling the assignment and onboarding of identities for agents, resources, and tools in an open way.
- Ensuring collision-free assignment and use of identities in multi-agentic systems.
- Defining methods enabling trustworthy assignment, onboarding, presentation, verification, and utilization of identities, including mechanisms to authenticate identifiers and their provenance.
- Addressing identity-centric requirements and standardization needs involving human-to-agent, agent-to-tool, agent-to-agent, and agent-to-human interactions.  
- Promoting openness and interoperability across multi-agentic systems and ecosystems, including seamless integration with Identity Providers (IdPs), Auth Servers and standard AuthN/AuthZ flows.

## Scope

This working group would be responsible of everything that is related to identity in multi-agentic systems, and will contribute to the [Identity](https://github.com/agntcy/identity) repository.
