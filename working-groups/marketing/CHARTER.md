* Content can be reviewed for alignment with AGNTCY governance and branding guidelines before publication. The review could happen at the TSC or one of the AGNTCY approved working groups. A brand and logo kit will be uploaded to the AGNTCY Google Drive for reference and use across all working groups.

* Asynchronous check-ins acceptable (e.g., updates over Slack or via shared doc) for contributors who cannot attend meetings. 

 

## 7\. Metrics & Success Indicators

Some ways to measure the effectiveness of the Marketing Group are listed in the table below. The top three current focus areas for the AGNTCY Marketing efforts include:

1. **Education**: Hands-On Labs and “how to” videos or blogs created by other AGNTCY working groups. Facilitate meetups and community interaction at in-person events.   
2. **AGNTCY on stage**: Aim to increase Call for Papers across AGNTCY stakeholders, representing what has been built and who it’s built for.  
3. **Use Case Stories**: Blogs, webinars, videos, etc published by AGNTCY members on their corporate blog channel.

Additional efforts include interacting with Analysts (ie Gartner, IDC, Forrester) to attain mentions in Analyst reports. Use cases, education, presentations could lead to earned media coverage.
