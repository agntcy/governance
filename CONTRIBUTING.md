# AGNTCY, a Series of LF Projects: Contributing Guide

Welcome to AGNTCY! We’re excited to welcome you to our community. Keep reading to learn more about how we’re building the Internet of Agents and where you can contribute.

## AGNTCY’s Mission

AGNTCY aims to create a common infrastructure layer for AI agent-to-agent collaboration across the complete multi-agent software lifecycle: from discovery and identification, to communication, deployment, observability, and evaluation. This open, interoperable ecosystem aims to securely and seamlessly unite AI agents together, regardless of their provided framework, vendor or platform.

## Purpose and Charter

Read more about the “why” behind AGNTCY via the [Operating Model document](OPERATING_MODEL.md).

## Code of Conduct

AGNTCY has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), ensuring a welcoming and respectful community. Please make sure to read and observe the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) while participating in the project.

## Start Contributing!

AGNTCY contains various sub-projects that you’re able to browse and interact with via Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions in the overall project. Across AGNTCY, all new inbound code contributions must be accompanied by a Developer Certificate of Origin, or [DCO](http://developercertificate.org), sign-off. You must include a sign-off in the commit message of your Pull Request for it to be accepted. The format for a sign-off is:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Each sub-project has their own CONTRIBUTING.md file where you can read up on the scope of the sub-project, how they complete reviews or submit bug reports, etc.

## Working Groups

Working groups exist to delegate technical decision-making across the complete multi-agent software lifecycle: they are responsible for the design and implementation of large architectural aspects of the overall AGNTCY project. Working groups operate with a fair amount of autonomy within the broader scope of the project. The [Technical Steering Committee](#technical-steering-committee-members) is responsible for approving the creation of working groups to handle specific scopes of authority, spanning several sub-projects. The processes that govern working group formation, operation, and dissolution are defined per the [working group processes](WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md) documentation. Contributions made under the direction and authority of working groups are expected to conform to the same processes defined in the AGNTCY [Operating Model](OPERATING_MODEL.md) document.

For more information about our working groups, including leadership roles and scope definition, please see our [Working Groups](working-groups/WORKING-GROUPS.md) documentation.
